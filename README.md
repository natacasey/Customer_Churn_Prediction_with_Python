## Project Description
The goal of the project was to create a model whose recall of the positive class is high enough to allow for the successful churn prediction of at least 2/3 of the customers whose personal data is used by businesses. 
The evaluation of 5 classification models showed that the Neural Network Classifier was the best candidate to perform the task well. The possible reasons for churning were examined by performing exploratory data analysis. The recommendations for improving the customer relationship and user retention were made. 
The analysis was not specific to any individual company. The data used - [Pew Reasearch Center American Trends Panel Wave 49](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-49/)

## Development

- Programming language - Python 3.7.2
- Programming language for variables summary - R 3.6.2
- Deep learning - Keras-Tensorflow
- OS  - Windows 10 Home

### Best performing model (postive recall - 72%)

## Limitations of the project

-	Many potential predictors were not used as they would be hard to measure by businesses 
-	Interpretability of the neural network algorithm is challenging. 


## Considerations for the future use

-	The final Neural Network Classification Model is especially useful for companies using loyalty programs and devices using personal data 
-	More data could be collected for higher performance
-	After using marketing means to address the issue uplift model could be used.
